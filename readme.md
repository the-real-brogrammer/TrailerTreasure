# [Trailer Treasure: One man's trailer is another man's treasure](https://the-real-brogrammer.github.io/TrailerTreasure/) 

## Pitch<br>
Picture this: you're at the theaters and see a trailer for a movie that you're immediately sold on. You know you **have** to watch this movie upon release. Of course, you don't want to be rude, so instead of jotting the movie down on your phone in the theater, you take a mental note. By the end of the movie however, you have no clue what the movie was called, who was in it, or what it was even about! You just know there is a mystery movie that you need to see without any way of finding it.<br> <br>
This app logs every trailer that plays for movies in the order they play, so you'll never have to worry about missing a promising new movie again!<br><br>

## Key Features
Movie Search – Quickly find any movie and pull up details, trailers, and release dates <br>
Now Playing & Upcoming – See what’s in theaters right now and what’s releasing soon <br>
Simple UI – Clean navigation with tabs for Home, Add Trailers, and Search <br>
<br>

## Use Cases + Target Audiences 
- Casual movie goers – Clean UI to navigate through all popular movies out now
- Cinephiles – Find all the trailers playing for a given movie
- Planners – Track upcoming releases and get notified when movies whose trailers they liked hit theaters<br>
<br>

## Why Now
Movie attendance is rebounding, with major releases drawing big audiences<br>
Trailers are how movies gain initial momentum, but there’s no dedicated app that treats them that way<br>
<br>

## The Opportunity
Build traction through TMDB data and user-contributed trailers
Monetize with advertisements from studios with upcoming movies as well as 3rd parties <br>
<br>


## Vision: To become the go-to movie discovery and trailer community app, making it easier and more fun to connect with films.
